                    <p class="lead"style="color:white;" >My name is Marina Bombal and I am a native French. I have been living in Edinburgh for almost 5 years. My living in the UK made me aware of the gap there is between our academic learning and the reality in the actual country! Despite
                        8+ years of learning English at school and at University in France, despite a good level in this language for all this time, I still struggled for my first 6 months in Scotland – as yes, there is a gap between knowing a language
                        for tourism or to read books, and knowing a language to speak, live and work in the country. You will tell me that Scotland was maybe a questionable choice as a place to learn a standard English… but I would answer that even in
                        England, there would have been a gap, and this gap is is often due to the way we learn languages at school.</p>

                    <p class="lead"style="color:white;">After 6 years working in the hospitality industry and as much time spent analysing the differences between English and French (languages!), I decided to start my own business as a self-employed French tutor : “FRENCH to take away”.
                        I have been pleased to discover the real enthusiasm and interest for French language in Scotland.I have been in charged with an Advanced level course with the Edinburgh Council Adult Education programme for 8 months (14 students)
                        and I have been giving private lessons since September 2018. Deliberately, I have been limiting the number of students I take in private lessons, as I wish to keep this activity as a part-time occupation so that I can save time
                        to build my few classes and develop the business administratively. Besides this, I am now taking a new step in starting intensive small group courses, a project I have since I started.
