            <p class="lead">As a private tutor, I make a point to install a comfortable and cosy atmosphere, favourable for learning in without feeling it as a duty. We can meet in your place, or in a coffee shop depending on the day. Any listening exercise will be given
                as a homework, so that if we are in a coffee shop, the shop’s environment doesn’t impact the learning. I believe that we learn better when we take the learning as an interesting game, and that is why I will tailor my training to your own
                centres of interest and learning goals.</p>
            <p class="lead">I will build my classes according to the objectives we would have defined together, with regular tests to assess your progression. Your training will be built in blocks of thematic. Lessons will usually include a bit of pronunciation, a bit
                of vocabulary, a bit of grammar and exercises based on a text or an audio document. Therefore, all rules will be assimilated progressively, although at time we may focus on specific grammar points of difficulties.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">The texts and documents are mostly modern cultural material i.e. recent book / film extract, with a language as contemporary as possible. It will be highly interactive, as the aim is for you to be able to use the language and gain confidence
                in speaking. This means we will often work on imaginary scenarios of practical situations and use voice recording to look back at the exercise. Sessions in different settings such as going for a walk or a visit to the museum can be organised,
                as I believe the sessions need to be as practical and fun as possible. PLEASE NOTE : At the moment, my private lessons are only built for adults, not for children. However, if there are requests for children it may be discussed. Cost of
                1 hour session : £20.</p>
