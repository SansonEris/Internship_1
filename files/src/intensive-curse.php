        <p class="lead">The intensive small group courses are training lasting between 4 and 8 weeks and focusing on a theme. They aim to deepen and perfect your knowledge of a particular subject. They would typically be 2 hours a week and take place in a fully equipped
            training room in Edinburgh. All content would be summarised in the course textbook. You would have homework and tests at the end of the course to assess your learning.
